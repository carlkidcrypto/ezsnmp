Introduction
------------

EzSnmp is a fork of `Easy SNMP <http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Python_Bindings>`__

Why Another Library?
--------------------

- Simple, because the maintainer of `Easy SNMP` seems to have abandoned the project and or isn't actively working on it.
- This version (EzSnmp) will attempt to remain up to date with Python versions that are supported by `Python <https://devguide.python.org/versions/>`__
  and net-snmp versions that are supported by `Net-SNMP <http://www.net-snmp.org/download.html>`__


How to Support This Project?
